# NJFair-App
This proof-of-concept demonstrates how data could be displayed from candidate applications in the state of New Jersey.

## To-Do List
* Migrate database to Postgresql for deployment
* Use a nicer CSS framework like Bulma maybe?
* Need upload form to continuously update database from front-end.
* Database optimized for CSV files only now, need to remedy that.
* Integrate [Google's Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/using_api)
* Look into utilizing [TAPinto's API](https://www.tapinto.net/) (if there is one)
* Do the same for [Patch](https://www.patch.com)
