# NJFair-App
This proof-of-concept demonstrates how data could be displayed from candidate applications in the state of New Jersey.

## To-Do List
* Migrate database to Postgresql for deployment
* Use a nicer CSS framework like Bulma maybe?
* Need upload form to continuously update database from front-end.
* Database optimized for CSV files only now.
